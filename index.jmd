# How to compute predicted win percentange?

White 7.5 komi advantage is estimated to be {{elo_white75_adv}} in Elo

Black 6.5 komi advantage is estimated to be {{elo_black65_adv}} in Elo

Using the **Elo Rating** it is

Probability that player with rating `r1` wins over someone with rating `r2` is `1/(1 + 10^((r2-r1)/400))`

# Ratings of players with fewer than 10 games (rating not reliable)
